Steps to mutant analyses:

1 - Create a folder named "testcases". This folder must be in VM_srciror.
2 - Copy all the csv files, generated by vm_samples_csv.py, to VM_srciror/testcases.
3 - Open main.c. Change the second line (NUM_TCs) to number of samples that you have defined when was running vm_samples.py.
4 - Run mutateSRC.sh. This file is in VM_srciror/mutants.
5 - Open renamer.java. Change the line 12 (MUTANTS) to number of mutants created. Number of files in VM_srciror/mutants minus 2.
6 - Run run.sh.
7 - The output with results is output.txt.
