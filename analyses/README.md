# Empirical Analyses

We have here all necessary files to reproduce our empirical analyses. The test cases (randomly generated) considered in our analyses are available in the following folders:

- NPP: [`raw_testcases`](https://github.com/igormeira/DFRScoq/tree/master/analyses/npp_srciror/raw_testcases);
- TIS: [`raw_testcases`](https://github.com/igormeira/DFRScoq/tree/master/analyses/tis_srciror/raw_testcases);
- VM: [`raw_testcases`](https://github.com/igormeira/DFRScoq/tree/master/analyses/vm_srciror/raw_testcases);

The test cases are grouped by 1, 5 and 10 calls to the QuickChick Sample function; considering five replications.
